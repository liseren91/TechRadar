# Tech Evolution Radar - Chrome Extension

Replaces the new-tab page with a calm radar of research and engineering
signals. The extension is a thin client: **it holds no API keys and calls no
third-party API.** Your TechRadar server fetches all thirteen sources, runs Jev
(categories, novelty, topics), translates, and scores; the extension renders
what `GET /api/extension-feed` returns.

## Features

- **One request per refresh** to your TechRadar server: feed, AI blog digest
  and topic momentum arrive together. The extension asks for no host
  permissions; the server's endpoints send CORS headers.
- **Settings** (gear button, also offered on the offline banner and the error
  screen): server address with validation and **Test connection**, language,
  auto-refresh (off / 5 / 10 / 30 / 60 min), feed size, default source and
  category, open links in a new tab, which panels to show, and **Clear saved
  data** / **Reset to defaults**. Stored in `chrome.storage.sync`, so they
  follow your Chrome profile. Changing the server discards the copy saved
  from the previous one.
- **Offline-first**: the last successful response is saved in
  `chrome.storage.local` and painted immediately on every new tab. If the
  server cannot be reached, the saved data stays on screen with a banner —
  "Not connected to the TechRadar server — showing data saved <time>" — and a
  **Retry** button. The failure is remembered, so later tabs keep asking the
  server (and keep the banner) until it answers; coming back online retries
  automatically.
- **Same signals as the dashboard**: server-computed score and highlight
  reasons (fast-rising, converging, new capability, under the radar), Jev
  categories and maturity.
- **Readable CJK text on any machine**: the server relays Noto Sans SC/JP
  (`/api/fonts/cjk`, unicode-range slices downloaded only when needed), so
  Chinese and Japanese titles never render as boxes.
- **Radar**: maturity rings, category colors, hover tooltip, click to open,
  keyboard navigation (arrows, Enter).
- **Languages**: English and Russian UI; server-made translations are shown
  with the original one click away.

## Installation

**Quickest:** download the latest build —
[tech-radar-extension.zip](https://github.com/lazarevtill/TechRadar/releases/latest/download/tech-radar-extension.zip)
(published by `.github/workflows/release-extension.yml` on every extension
change to `main`) — unzip it, open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer
mode**, click **Load unpacked** and pick the `tech-radar-extension` folder.

**From source:**

1. Run the server: `docker compose up -d` (serves `http://localhost:3000`).
2. Build the extension: `bun run build:extension`, or use **Download
   Extension** on the dashboard.
3. Open `chrome://extensions/`, enable **Developer mode**, click **Load
   unpacked** and select `dist/extension/unpacked` (or the extracted
   `tech-radar-extension` folder).
4. If your server is not at `http://localhost:3000`, open **Settings** (gear
   icon) and enter its address — `localhost:3000`, a LAN address such as
   `192.168.1.20:3000`, or `radar.example.com` (bare hosts get `https://`,
   local and LAN hosts `http://`). **Test connection** shows what the server
   returns before you save.

A different default for fresh installs can be baked in at build time:

```bash
EXTENSION_BACKEND_URL=https://radar.example.com bun run build:extension
# Docker image whose "Download Extension" uses that default:
EXTENSION_BACKEND_URL=https://radar.example.com docker compose up --build -d
```

## File structure

```
chrome-extension/
├── manifest.json        # MV3 manifest; host/CSP limited to the server
├── newtab.html          # New-tab page
├── styles.css           # Styles
├── app.js               # Loading, offline state, rendering

```

The build walks the reference graph from `manifest.json` and ships only what
the page loads (tests, this README and dev tools are never packaged).

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not connected to the TechRadar server"**: start it (`docker compose up -d`),
  or open **Settings** from the banner and check the address with **Test
  connection**, then press **Retry**.
- **Stale numbers**: the saved copy refreshes every 10 minutes and on the
  refresh button; the server itself serves a snapshot at most 5 minutes old.

## Permissions

- **storage**: the saved feed and your settings
- No host permissions. The CSP keeps scripts local (`script-src 'self'`) and
  allows remote requests only for data, styles and fonts, because the server
  address is a user setting.
