 * them. What it is good at is reading one item and answering questions about
 * what the item *is*: whether it describes a genuinely new capability, whether
 * it is a concrete technical artifact rather than commentary, and which
 * tracked topics it belongs to. Those are the inputs `computeSignals` cannot
 * derive from counts.
 *
 * One request per item with all questions batched in it (cheaper and faster
 * than one call per question, per TypeSafe's cookbook), cached per item id
 * for a day. A failed or unconfigured call yields `null`: the model then
 * scores the item from engagement only and never invents novelty.
