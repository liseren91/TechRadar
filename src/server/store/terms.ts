/**
 * Candidate terms from item titles, extracted in code (no model): the raw
 * material for discovering topics nobody listed in trend-topics.ts.
 *
 * Two kinds, both cheap and deterministic:
 *  - name-like tokens: model, product and method names are shaped unlike
 *    ordinary words — letters with digits ("Qwen3.5", "GPT-6"), inner
 *    capitals ("WorldCrafter", "LoRA"), or short all-caps acronyms ("VLA");
 *  - two-word phrases of content words ("world model", "diffusion policy").
 * Most candidates are noise; what makes one interesting is *behaviour over
 * time* (new, bursting, reused across sources), and only those few are ever
 * shown to Jev (discovery.ts).
