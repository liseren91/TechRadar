/**
 * The radar's track record: every highlight is a prediction ("this will
 * matter more than its peers"), and HORIZON_DAYS later it is checked.
 *
 * Outcomes are measured against a control group, never against an absolute
 * bar. When items are highlighted, the same number of non-highlighted items
 * from the same source and day is recorded as `control` (chosen by a hash of
 * the id, so the choice is reproducible). At evaluation:
 *
 *  - sources with an attention metric (stars, points, likes, upvotes,
 *    citations): growth = ln(1 + now) − ln(1 + then), re-read from the
 *    source (metric-refetch.ts);
 *  - sources without one (arXiv, PubMed, HAL, CiNii, bioRxiv): growth = the
 *    number of other sources the work reached since, from the history store.
 *
 * A highlight is a hit when its growth beats the median growth of its cohort's
 * controls (same source, same day). A random pick would hit about half the
 * time — that is the bar.
 *
 * Discovered themes are predictions too (`discovered`, subject `auto:<term>`):
 * a hit when, in the HORIZON_DAYS after it was added, new items carrying the
 * term keep arriving at no less than half the daily rate of the burst that
 * added it (burst: RECENT_DAYS = 7, horizon 14, so "after >= baseline").
