# Gap audit — TechRadar

Scope: `main` at `70e084d` (after the history-store merge). Question: what is
still missing for long-term running, and for the goal of seeing what others
can't because of the volume of information.

Method: three read-only passes (server pipeline, both clients, ops/CI/docs),
then the high-severity claims re-checked by hand. Every finding cites the
code; line numbers are at `70e084d`. Nothing was fixed during the audit.

Severity: **H** = wrong or lost data, or a failure that goes unnoticed ·
**M** = missing capability or a real risk · **L** = polish.

In Docker the image healthcheck happens to fetch `/` every 30 s (`Dockerfile:45-46`), and the page render prefetches the feed, so rebuilds happen by accident. | Add an explicit in-process schedule (rebuild every 5 min). Only then re-point the healthcheck (R6). |

A 500, a DNS failure and "no new items" all record as `items=0, error=null`, so health and alerts can't say _why_ a source is down.                                                                                                                        | Fetchers return or throw error detail; `withinBudget` records it.                                   |

| D5  | L   | `package.json:12`                 | `test:parsers` is still broken and unused.                                                                           | Remove it or reimplement it.                     |

## 6. Capability gaps for the goal

These are judgments about what's missing, not code defects.

1. **Themes can't be followed over time.** The history store holds daily term and topic counts, but nothing plots a theme's curve, when it started or who carried it first. That curve, drawn from 13 sources, is what shows a trend before others notice it.
2. **Discovery sees only titles.** `extractTerms(item.title)` (`history.ts:84`) skips summaries, repo topics, arXiv categories and HF tags, which is where most method and model names appear first.
3. **No entity layer.** Labs, companies, authors and repos that recur across sources are not tracked (for example "which lab shipped three trending things this month").
4. **Watch terms only reach you weekly.** A watched term's first appearance, or a burst, doesn't trigger an immediate webhook.
5. **The digest pipeline doesn't use the store.** `scripts/generate-feed` keeps its own series in `public/data/history.json` and never sees discovered themes, so there are two ways of counting topics.
6. **Blocked sources:** patents (needs your USPTO Open Data Portal API key), Reddit (needs an OAuth app), Bluesky (403 without auth). All three are independent signal types: commercial intent, practitioner discussion and social discussion.
7. **No export or API for the long history** (CSV/JSON of theme curves, the prediction log). The data exists but can only be seen through the fixed panels.

## Summary

| Area               | Findings (H/M/L) | Rough completeness                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Running unattended | 3/5/4            | ~70% — works, but relies on traffic and records too little about failures |
| Signal correctness | 1/2/3            | ~85% — the model is sound; the track record loses data silently           |
| Exposure           | 1/3/1            | ~60% — writes and cost-bearing calls are open                             |
| Clients            | 2/6/4            | ~75% — new features shown, but uneven between the two clients             |
| CI/deploy/docs     | 0/4/1            | ~70%                                                                      |

**Could not verify** (needs the live deployment or accounts): the replica count and any proxy or auth in front of `/api/*`; real traffic and how often rebuilds happen; how long `VACUUM INTO` blocks at full size; upstream keyless rate limits under the evaluation load; screen-reader and contrast behavior; the digest CI job's Jev re-send behavior.

| R1  | Fixed   | `9e62f0b`            | Custom server entry starts an in-process schedule (`FEED_SCHEDULE_MINUTES`, default 5); maintenance runs from it.                                                            |
| R2  | Fixed   | `9e62f0b`            | Fetchers rethrow; the budget wrapper records the reason. `0ab9aba`: CiNii/HF/Lobsters/preprints fail on a real outage.                                                       |

| R4  | Fixed   | `9e62f0b`            | Every expected source listed; `ok` false for down sources, a stale feed or a stale backup; `problems` in words.                                                              |
| R5  | Fixed   | `0ab9aba`            | `BACKUP_DIR` for an off-volume copy; maintenance runs after the rebuild, not inside it; README documents the restore.                                                        |
| R6  | Fixed   | `9e62f0b`            | Healthcheck probes `/api/health` (safe now that R1 no longer depends on it).                                                                                                 |

| R9  | Fixed   | `0ab9aba`            | `busy_timeout`, idempotent theme insert, one alert in flight; "one replica" in README and CLAUDE.md.                                                                         |
| R10 | Fixed   | `0ab9aba`            | Usage is recorded at the end of the rebuild, after translation.                                                                                                              |
| R11 | Fixed   | `0ab9aba`            | Last-seen refreshes at most daily, so unchanged runs do not rewrite the file.                                                                                                |
| R12 | Changed | `0ab9aba`            | Not shortened: bioRxiv needs 40–60 s, a shorter timeout would lose it. Instead one fetch per source at a time and an hour cache, so the late result serves the next rebuild. |
| S1  | Fixed   | `0ab9aba`            | Failed reads retried daily (3 attempts); `unavailable`/`unmatched` counted and shown in both clients.                                                                        |

| C2  | Fixed   | `f372287`            | Shared watch-terms hook: chips on rows, feed filter, clickable terms in This week.                                                                                           |
| C3  | Fixed   | `f372287`, `b1809bf` | "+N/day measured" vs "≈N/day on average" in both clients; help texts updated.                                                                                                |
| C4  | Fixed   | `f372287`, `b1809bf` | "first seen" on rows and in the detail dialog.                                                                                                                               |
| C5  | Fixed   | `b1809bf`            | Extension lists discovered themes; footer shows server health (CORS added).                                                                                                  |
| C6  | Fixed   | `f372287`            | Topic rows and themes narrow the dashboard feed.                                                                                                                             |
| C7  | Fixed   | `f372287`            | Error states in Highlights, Topics and the summary; track record never a bare label; health failure shown.                                                                   |
| C8  | Fixed   | `b1809bf`            | Translated accessible names (`data-i18n-label`); info dialog labelled.                                                                                                       |
| C9  | Fixed   | `f372287`            | Report waits for hydration; loading and empty states.                                                                                                                        |
| C10 | Fixed   | `b1809bf`            | Manifest and README say thirteen sources; version 1.6.0.                                                                                                                     |
| C11 | Fixed   | `f372287`, `b1809bf` | `aria-pressed` on toggles; hints and dates visible as text.                                                                                                                  |
| C12 | Fixed   | `f372287`, `b1809bf` | Unused keys and export removed; threshold from the server; horizon from the track record.                                                                                    |
| D1  | Fixed   | `3a97b46`            | Node 22 pinned in Verify; `engines` declared.                                                                                                                                |
| D2  | Fixed   | `3a97b46`            | `scripts/smoke-store.ts` runs the store on `bun:sqlite` in CI; the image is started and `/api/health` checked before publishing.                                             |
| D3  | Fixed   | `3a97b46`            | Publish runs after Verify succeeds (`workflow_run`), builds and tags the verified commit.                                                                                    |
| D4  | Fixed   | docs                 | README, CLAUDE.md, `.env.example`, compose describe the current system, settings, security model, backups and restore.                                                       |
| D5  | Fixed   | `9e62f0b`            | `test:parsers` removed; health from real rebuilds replaces it.                                                                                                               |

| --- | ------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Built   | `e5b63b1` | Per topic: new works per day for 30 days and its origin, drawn as sparklines in both clients.                        |
| 2   | Built   | `4a31b66` | Discovery and theme membership also use the names in summaries.                                                      |
| 3   | Built   | `0c17d4a` | Most active makers (GitHub/HF owners) in the weekly report, both clients and the text report.                        |
| 4   | Built   | `12c8d88` | Immediate webhook alerts for server watch terms; delivered once, retried on failure, no flood on enable.             |
| 5   | Decided | docs      | Kept separate on purpose: the digest series counts blog posts, the store counts live-source items; documented.       |
| 6   | Blocked | —         | Needs credentials only the owner can create: USPTO Open Data Portal key (patents), a Reddit OAuth app, Bluesky auth. |
| 7   | Built   | `9f8ca55` | `/api/export` with `kind` = series, predictions or themes, `format` = csv or json.                                   |

Found while fixing (not in the original audit): the extension's HTML
escaping left quotes intact inside attributes (fixed in `9c6854d`); on-demand
translation was an unbounded public path to the shared MyMemory quota (now
30 a minute, `9c6854d`); two more dead public server functions (removed).
